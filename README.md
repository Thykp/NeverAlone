# NeverAlone

Welcome to the **NeverAlone** GitHub repository! This project is a socially-focused dating application designed to foster deeper, meaningful connections, moving away from surface-level interactions to combat the loneliness epidemic often exacerbated by dating apps.

## Project Overview

The app aims to address common user pain points, such as shallow conversations, cluttered interfaces, and limited interaction opportunities. Our solution combines intuitive design, enhanced filters, engaging quiz games, and options that go beyond traditional dating to create genuine connections.
